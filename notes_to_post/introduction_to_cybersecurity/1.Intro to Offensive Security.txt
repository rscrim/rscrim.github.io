Title: Intro to Offensive Security - Hack your first website (legally in a safe environment) and experience an ethical hacker's job.

Notes:
Task 1  Hacking your first machine
Step 1) Open a terminal
    You got dis!

Step 2) Find hidden website pages
    gobuster - Brute-forces hidden paths on web servers and more.
    Project link: https://github.com/OJ/gobuster

    Discover directories and files that match in the wordlist
    $ gobuster dir --url [https://example.com/] --wordlist [path/to/file]

    Discover subdomains
    $ gobuster dns --domain [example.com] --wordlist [path/to/file]

    Discover Amazon S3 buckets
    $ gobuster s3 --wordlist [path/to/file]

    Discover other virtual hosts on the server
    $ gobuster vhost --url [https://example.com/] --wordlist [path/to/file]

    Fuzz the value of a parameter
    $ gobuster fuzz --url [https://example.com/?parameter=FUZZ] --wordlist [path/to/file]

    Fuzz the name of a parameter
    $ gobuster fuzz --url [https://example.com/?FUZZ=value] --wordlist [path/to/file]

    More info - https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/gobuster.1.html or `man gobuster`

    Breaking down the tutorial command
    `gobuster -u http://fakebank.com -w wordlist.txt dir`
    This is running the gobuster tool against the website (http://fakebank.com) looking for possible pages with names listed in the wordlist.txt file.

    As you can tell the efficacy of this is really determined by the contents of the wordlist.txt file which you can view by running `cat ~/Desktop/wordlist.txt` on your provided machine.
    A quick Google search can help you find a pre-created wordlist for your own adventures. Eg: https://github.com/topics/gobuster-wordlist
    However for more targeted campaigns, its probably better to modify this to include suspected pages.

    The output of this command will show all pages found.

Step 3) Hack the bank
    Look at the returned known pages from the gobuster command and explore adding these to the URL in your browser.
    Its important to note that this is a testing lab and it would be highly unlikely that such a page wouldn't require authentication in the real world.

    Answer the questions below
When you've transferred money to your account, go back to your bank account page. What is the answer shown on your bank balance page?
To discover the answer to this, head back to http://fakebank.com or click the fakebank logo.
The flag will be listed in a banner on the main page
Solution: BANK-HACKED

Task 2  What is Offensive Security?
Copy pasta from the site - nothing more to add.
In short, offensive security is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.

To beat a hacker, you need to behave like a hacker, finding vulnerabilities and recommending patches before a cybercriminal does, as you did in this room!

On the flip side, there is also defensive security, which is the process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats; learn more in the digital forensics room.

In a defensive cyber role, you could be investigating infected computers or devices to understand how it was hacked, tracking down cybercriminals, or monitoring infrastructure for malicious activity.

Task 3  Careers in cyber security
A good article on the various teams in cyber security is listed here: https://medium.com/securebit/understanding-cyber-security-teams-and-roles-cf964d7737ae
There are also a plethora of youtube videos out there on such a topic.
